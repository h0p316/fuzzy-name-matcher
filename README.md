# fuzzy-name-matcher
Fuzzy name matching service using Jaccard similarity, Levenshtein distance, and word permutations to deliver realistic similarity scores between customer and beneficiary names. Built with Java 17, Spring Boot, and Apache Commons Text.


# Fuzzy Name Matcher

A Spring Boot service for fuzzy name matching that calculates a **realistic similarity score** between two names using:
- **Word-level Jaccard similarity** (checks how many words overlap)
- **Levenshtein distance** (measures character-level edits needed to match)
- **Word permutations** (handles name order changes)

This is especially useful in **banking / KYC / customer verification** workflows where names may be slightly different due to typos, ordering, or missing parts.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Realistic scoring** (0.00 ‚Äì 100.00%)
- Handles:
  - Typo tolerance  
  - Missing middle names  
  - Different word orders  
  - Extra spaces and special characters
- REST API with **OpenAPI/Swagger UI** for easy testing
- Built with **Java 17 + Spring Boot 3** for modern performance

## üìä Scoring Logic

**Step 1:** Normalize  
- Lowercase  
- Remove special characters  
- Trim spaces  

**Step 2:** Generate permutations of the customer name (to handle name order changes)  

**Step 3:** For each permutation:
- Calculate **Jaccard similarity** on words  
- Calculate **Levenshtein similarity** on characters  
- Take the **average** of both scores  

**Step 4:** Select the **highest** score from all permutations and return as a percentage.
